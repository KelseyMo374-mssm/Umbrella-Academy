# Excel Tips and Tricks
This exercise will teach you a few of the most useful tips for data manipulation and cleaning in Excel. 

## ⤵️Step 1: Importing Data
One of the most annoying and detrimental features of Excel is how much it **loves** to convert data, especially fractions (➗), into dates (📅).

I've saved our test dataset as a `.txt` file to illustrate this.

### 1.1 Download [raw_star_wars.txt](data/raw_star_wars.txt).

Open Excel, select Open 📂, then Browse 📂 and navigate to your Downloads folder.

You will see something that looks like this, and you will ask yourself, "Where is the file that I literally just downloaded?"

You will then go to the dropdown in the bottom right and change it from "All Excel Files" to "All Files"
