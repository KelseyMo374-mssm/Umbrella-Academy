## Introduction

The goal of **The Umbrella Academy** is to familiarize "wet lab" scientists with useful "dry lab" tools. Therefore, this exercise is geared primarily towards basic data manipulation to generate aesthetically pleasing plots in R.

R is an excellent tool for generating beautiful data visualizations, and is much more flexible and customizable than other tools like Excel or GraphPad.

Another major benefit of R is that it is, and (hopefully) always will be, free to use and open source, unlike other proprietary statistical computing software like SAS or STATA.

But first, before we dive into the exercise itself, let's familiarize ourselves with some basics of working with R in RStudio.

### R and RStudio

By now, you should have installed what's often called **"Base-R."**

**What is R?**

According to its creators,

> R is "a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics" and "an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display."

(You can read more about it [here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).)

But what does that mean in practice?

You might have run R after you installed it, and seen something like this, magically transporting yourself to circa 2004:

![**Base R GUI.** This always reminds me of an AIM chat window (if anyone is old enough to remember that).](assets/RGui.png)

This is "Base-R," and it's not especially user-friendly (where are you even supposed to start? how do you run a command?). While it's perfectly functional, it's not the ideal way to interact with R.

Enter: **RStudio**.

I'm writing this exercise in RStudio right now, see? ![RStudio screenshot](assets/RStudio.png)

To be honest, I've been coding in R since 2017 and have never once written a script or performed an analysis in Base-R.

Maybe you can see why -- RStudio is what's called an **"integrative development environment" (IDE).**

This goes beyond even a "graphical user interface" (GUI), in that it provides tools to write, execute, and debug R code, manage the objects and variables you create, keep track of your files and projects, render plots, read help documentation... the list goes on.

So let's dive in!

### Navigating RStudio

#### Working directories

Remember in our [last lesson](../Command-Line/Command_Line_Exercise.md) when we learned the command `pwd` to see what directory we were in on the HPC?

There is a similar command in R:

```{r}
getwd()
```

You can see I'm currently in my project directory on the Zamarin Lab computer.

The syntax for commands in R is typically the `function` followed by the arguments to the function in parentheses `(arguments)`.

With `getwd()`, we're asking the question of what directory we're in, so we aren't giving it any arguments. But if we want to *change* the directory, we can use the below command, giving it the path of the directory we want to move to:

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Zamarin Lab/Documents/GitHub/Umbrella-Academy/R-Project")
```

::: callout-note
`getwd()` is short for "**get** working directory" (whereas `pwd` was "**print** working directory").

`setwd()` is short for "**set** working directory."

You can remember these since "set" and "get" rhyme!
:::

#### R Projects

Some people believe very strongly that you should never include `setwd()` in your R scripts. In fact, they even threaten to [come to your office and set your computer on fire🔥](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).

Rather, they argue that it is much better to create a folder for the specific project you are working on, and then create an R Project (or similar, but for our purposes we will discuss R Projects).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
##### What is an R Project?

-   A type of file that functions with RStudio
-   They have the `.Rproj` file extension
-   R projects are each associated with a directory
-   They are useful when working with many files for one purpose, hence the name “project”
-   They “know” which files are relevant to a project: when you open the project, RStudio will load those files automatically
-   If we are working in an R project, our working directory is automatically set as the folder that the project is associated with -- so no need to use `setwd()` (and have our computers set on fire🔥)
-   This is especially useful if you need to move your project directory or change computers -- you don't have to rewrite the path to your working directory if the project moves, which is really beneficial for collaboration and reproducibility

For this exercise, we will create an R Project, just to teach best practices.

#### RStudio Windows

If you launch RStudio now, you will see three panes (or windows).

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
##### Before we progress...

...we need to turn off a few RStudio defaults that will make our lives better.

Basically, in an ideal world, you should be able to run all your code from start to finish and get the same result.

However, RStudio's default behavior is to *restore your previous workspace*. This can cause problems since your previous workspace might include objects or data from a different project or version of your code, making it difficult to reproduce your results consistently. More on this [here](https://www.sesync.org/resources/tips-smooth-rstudio-workflow-and-reproducible-r-code).

**To turn off workspace saving and loading:**

-   Tools -\> Global Options -\> General -\> Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”
-   Tools -\> Global Options -\> General -\> Change “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never” ![](assets/Global_Options.png)
:::

Now that we've turned off those defaults, let's create a new script so you can see all four of the typical windows you will be working with when coding in RStudio:

![Create a new script by going to File -\> New File -\> R Script](assets/New_File.png)

Now you should see something like this:

![**The four RStudio windows.** Yours may be in a different orientation than in this figure. These images and annotations are from the silly yet useful book [*YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R*](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png)

-   The **Console** is the same as if you had just launched Base-R -- you can enter and run commands here, but they will not be stored for future use.
-   The **Source** section (with your new script) can also be generated in Base-R
    -   However, there's no "Run" button in Base-R to run your code.
    -   That said, it's much faster and easier to use a keyboard shortcut to execute your codes -- just type `CTRL + Enter`.
    -   Try that now by typing `getwd()`, followed by `CTRL + Enter`.
    -   This will work in either the **Console** or the **Source**.
    -   If you ran it in the **Console**, you'll note that the command disappeared. Try using the `Up` arrow to retrieve the command and run it again!
-   We haven't created any variables (yet) to go into the **Environment**, but check out the **History** tab -- you should see the `getwd()` command(s) you just ran!
-   The last window with **Files, Plots, Packages, etc.** will also look fairly empty, but not for long!

#### RStudio Projects

As promised, we will create an R Project for this exercise.

Go ahead and close your new script containing the brilliant and groundbreaking code you just wrote (`getwd()`), no need to save it.

Now, create a new project and new directory:

![Create a new project by going to File -\> New Project. Then create a New Directory, and finally New Project.](assets/New_Proj.png)

You can name your new directory whatever you'd like, as long as you remember it's for this project.

Now we'll go back and create a new R script in our project folder.

::: callout-note
For this exercise, we will be using an R script to write and execute our code.

There are other document types, like R Markdown, or the newer Quarto (this is actually a Quarto document). These file types are a bit more advanced and require you to know Markdown syntax, but can be very helpful for actual projects. They allow you to combine code, text, and output very seamlessly, which is good for reproducibility.

If you want to learn more, I highly recommend this course, [*Productive R Workflow*](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/). Contact me if you are interested; the creator offers group rates for teams.

Okay, so we now have our R Project and our fresh new script. It's almost time to begin!

### Data Types and Variables

Every basic programming class with include this section (in fact, if you completed your [homework](https://vscodeedu.com/courses/intro-to-python) this should look quite familiar, though R and Python are slightly different in this regard).

I'll try to make this brief:

#### Variable Structures in R

-   **Data Frame:** A table-like structure with rows and columns. Each column can store a different data type, making it ideal for organizing datasets.
-   **Tibble:** A modern version of a data frame, offering improved printing behavior and no row names by default.
-   **Vector:** A one-dimensional collection that holds elements of the same data type.
-   **List:** An ordered collection that can store elements of different types, allowing greater flexibility.
-   **Matrix:** A two-dimensional version of a vector with rows and columns, where all elements share the same type.
-   **Array:** A multi-dimensional collection, similar to a matrix but capable of handling more than two dimensions.

You will likely most often be working with **Data Frames** or **Tibbles** to create figures, but will probably use all of the variable types at one point or another.

#### Data Types in R

-   **Numeric:** The default type used for numbers, including decimals.
-   **Factor:** A special structure for categorical data that defines a limited set of values.
-   **Integer:** Whole numbers explicitly defined with an "L" suffix (e.g., 10L).
-   **Logical:** Represents Boolean values: TRUE or FALSE.
-   **Character:** Text strings used to represent words or sentences.
-   **Complex:** Numbers that include both a real and an imaginary component (e.g., 2+3i).
-   **Raw:** Used for storing raw byte data.

Some of these you won't interact with much (I've never worked with Complex or Raw data, I don't think...), others are pretty essential. **Factors** are especially important, and we will discuss them more later.

These definitions are drawn from [this R Workshop GitHub](https://github.com/MVesuviusC/R_workshop/tree/main), which inspired a few other sections of this class (thank you, [MVesuviusC](https://github.com/MVesuviusC)!).

#### Identifying Variable Structures and Data Types

##### The `str()` function

There is an extremely useful function in R to tell you the structure of an object: `str()`

Here I'm going to show the difference between a **Numeric** variable and an **Integer**, by creating two **Vectors**:

```{r}
num <- c(1,2,3)
str(num)
int <- c(1L,2L,3L)
str(int)
```

We created the variables using `<-`, otherwise known as the `assignment operator`, and then checked their structure by passing the object (either `num` or `int`) to the `str()` function.

If you want, you can *coerce* a data type into another one.

```{r}
# Let's say I actually wanted `num` to be an integer:
num <- as.integer(num)
str(num)

# Or even a character:
num <- as.character(num)
str(num)
```

But, oops, actually, just kidding, I really wanted `num` to be numeric. We can change it back:

```{r}
num <- as.numeric(num)
str(num)
```

::: {.callout-caution}
**Be careful not to coerce a variable into an impossible data type!**
:::

Note what happens if we try to coerce a character vector into a numeric vector, even if we know that the character vector *could* represent a number:
```{r}
number <- c("one","two","three")
str(number)

number <- as.numeric(number)
str(number)
```
R isn't reading and evaluating what our character variables to assume what they might mean, so it isn't going to automatically convert `one` into `1`. If you have numeric variables in your dataset, it's best to save them initially as numbers in your raw data, and treat them as either numeric or integer variables in R. 

##### Why use **Factors**?

::: callout-warning
**The default behavior in R is to treat text variables alphabetically** unless we specify otherwise.

Here's an example where that might become confusing.

Say we had a dataset from a contest, where participants could come in first, second, third, or fourth.

```{r}
rankings <- c("first","second","third","fourth")
# If we look at the structure of our variable, we see them in the order we would expect...
str(rankings)

# But if we use the table() function to summarize the data, we see it lists them alphabetically
table(rankings)

```

How do we fix this if we want them to be ordered logically, from first to fourth?
:::

This is where the **factor** variable type comes in. We can specify that this categorical variable is a factor, and tell it the levels we expect:

```{r}
rankings <- as.factor(rankings)
# If we just coerce the variable into a factor, we still have the same problem, 
# because R doesn't know that we want them in order:
str(rankings)
table(rankings)

# Instead, we can explicitly tell it the order we want with the "levels" argument:
rankings <- factor(rankings, levels=c("first","second","third","fourth"))
table(rankings)

# We can set the levels to be whatever we want -- for example, we could list them backwards:
rankings <- factor(rankings, levels=c("fourth","third","second","first"))
table(rankings)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
###### Extra Credit

Why did the `str()` function print the rankings in the correct order the very first time, even though using the `table()` function showed that R was treating them alphabetically?

Because when we created the `rankings` variable, we entered the variable names in the logical order. If we had created the variable with them out of order, they would have printed out of order, but R would still treat them alphabetically:

```{r}
rankings <- c("third","second","fourth","first")
# Prints the character variable in a silly order
str(rankings)
# But treats it alphabetically
table(rankings)

```
:::

Changing the levels of your **factor** variables can be very useful when it comes to plotting data, as we will see.
