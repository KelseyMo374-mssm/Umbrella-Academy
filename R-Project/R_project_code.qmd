## Introduction

The goal of **The Umbrella Academy** is to familiarize "wet lab" scientists with useful "dry lab" tools they may want to use. Therefore, this exercise is geared primarily towards basic data manipulation to generate aesthetically pleasing plots.

R is an excellent tool for generating beautiful data visualizations, and is much more flexible and customizable than other tools like Excel or GraphPad.
